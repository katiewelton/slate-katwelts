# Shopify theme with SLATE

This is a trial run for collaborating on a new theme build with Slate for Shopify.

## Preparation

* You will need npm    
* [Slate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/slate): `npm install -g @shopify/slate`
* Check Slate is now running `slate --version`


## Set up project

* Clone this repo
* Create your config.yml file `cp config-sample.yml config.yml`
* Using your preferred editor update your store name, password and theme id in your config.yml file
  (Please note you will only need to update the theme id if you are NOT only editing your live theme.)


## Start project

* Build project `npm i`
* Run slate with watchers for automatic browser updating `slate start`

This should open a new localhost window in your browser. This is a preview window, to see the changes to your live theme just refresh your browser.
